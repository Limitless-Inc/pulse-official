Pulse is a modern school sickbay management app designed to replace the traditional book-based system. It allows nurses to quickly record, search, and track student illness and treatment history in one secure digital platform. By eliminating paper records, Pulse saves time, reduces errors, and ensures faster, more efficient care for students.
